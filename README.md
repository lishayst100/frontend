## Hello dear tester,
First of all, thank you for checking the project for me and if there are any comments about it, please let me know and I will fix it.
My name is Lishay Shem Tov and this is my middle project in React,
The idea of my project was actually to make an online store for buying phones and also to upload second hand products for sale on a dedicated page.
I used several tools and they are: react redux javascript and sass
To set up an api for myself I used node.js.
To run the project, go to the backend folder and run the "nodemon" command in the terminal.
Then, to run the project and see it, enter the "frontend" folder and run the "npm start" command.

### Home page:

As you can see on the home page there is a list of phones and a number of filters where you can sort the phones by price, by software and by name and there is also an option to search for phones in a text box as well as a button that filters only Apple products./
Each product has two buttons, one to add to cart and the other button is a link to details about that product./

### Shopping cart:

On the shopping cart page there is a list of products that you added to the cart from the home page./ You have the ability to add a quantity of the same product, remove the desired product, as well as remove all the products in the cart./ Everything is saved in local storage./

### Second hand cards page:
On the cards page you have the ability to add a card, edit an existing card and also delete a card from the list here too everything is saved in local storage.
